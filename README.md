# Command Line Utilities

Here are some handy tools I've made over the years.
These are mostly for my own `macos` environment, and will probably need tinkering in other envs.

- See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the restrictions that it applies.
- Check out the [INFO.md](INFO.md) file for information about each program.

Use at your own will.

Enjoy!
