# Command Line Utilities

Here are some handy tools I've made over the years.
These are mostly for my own `macos` environment, and will probably need tinkering in other envs.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository and type `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fdch/cmdutils
cd cmdutils
make
```

This creates symbolic links to the programs inside `src`.

NOTE: By default, [linker.sh](linker.sh) will create a target directory in `~/bin`.
If you would like to install in a different directory, then run `make install DESTDIR='your/own/dir'`

## Usage

Check out the [INFO.md](INFO.md) file for information about each program.

## LICENSE

Read the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the restrictions that it applies.

## Warning

Use at your own will.
